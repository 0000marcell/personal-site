I’ve been hanging around in <strong>Chile</strong> for a while and I felt that I had to visit this place before leaving the country.</p>\n<p>Despite heading there during the end of the year holidays, I was in a regular work routine and I had a few things to sort out on some personal projects, so I headed there expecting to keep myself active.</p>\n<p>I thought that my biggest trouble would be the dust covering my devices, but I also faced some other interesting challenges. In the first days, I started to question myself if it was really a good idea to go there while working. But I held tightly and accepted those challenges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"infrastructure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#infrastructure\" aria-label=\"infrastructure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Infrastructure</h2>\n<p>This was probably the most intimidating aspect for me but ended up being pretty manageable.</p>\n<p><strong>There is little to no broadband internet</strong> infrastructure. Most places have wifi, but as deep as I looked, <strong>all of them runs on mobile data at the end</strong>. I was totally not aware of this and just noticed after arriving. It kind of scared me at first, especially because the connection in the hostel I stayed in was painfully bad.</p>\n<p>After a few days digging around, I found a cafe on <a href=\"https://workfrom.co/\">workfrom</a> that had better than average wifi. Soon I noticed that it had a special setup: <strong>dedicated mobile data antennas</strong> outside that looks a lot more reliable than the small 4G dongles that I found in other venues:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/7ed56/mobile-antennas.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"mobile antennas\"\n        title=\"mobile antennas\"\n        src=\"/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/bef96/mobile-antennas.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/eb137/mobile-antennas.jpg 256w,\n/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/6af86/mobile-antennas.jpg 512w,\n/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/bef96/mobile-antennas.jpg 1024w,\n/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/bbc21/mobile-antennas.jpg 1536w,\n/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/cbeb6/mobile-antennas.jpg 2048w,\n/static/ad8505f76f3ab240bc9f6cc0d5ea280f/7ed56/mobile-antennas.jpg 4000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>It was better, but not enough. I still suffered from some stability drops when the cafe was full and also with the high cafe prices. So I soon realized it would be just better to <strong>use my phone as a 4G hotspot</strong>. So I just rolled with that, and it ended up working really well, and cheap: ~7 USD for 10GB, which for me lasted on average 1 week.</p>\n<p>Still, I would go out to cafes a few times a week to try different work environments. Some are very nice and unique.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/d1de6/cafe-inside.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.203125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"cafe inside\"\n        title=\"cafe inside\"\n        src=\"/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/bef96/cafe-inside.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/eb137/cafe-inside.jpg 256w,\n/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/6af86/cafe-inside.jpg 512w,\n/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/bef96/cafe-inside.jpg 1024w,\n/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/bbc21/cafe-inside.jpg 1536w,\n/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/cbeb6/cafe-inside.jpg 2048w,\n/static/f774cf9efd8844be8560a276511dec7c/d1de6/cafe-inside.jpg 3080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"atmosphere\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#atmosphere\" aria-label=\"atmosphere permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Atmosphere</h2>\n<p>The air is very dry, so my nose — and everyone else’s — was irritated the whole time, and blowing your nose turns into a morning ritual. I think blowing/cleaning your nose must be more socially accepted there because you just can’t avoid it. I got surprised on an almost daily basis on what came out of it 😂</p>\n<p>It can get very hot during the day, and you must also be worried about protecting yourself from sunlight.</p>\n<p>Apart from those aspects, the place is just wonderful. It’s hard to describe, it feels like a magical place.

I was able to get a lot of stuff done, even with the not so ideal infrastructure and uncomfortable climate. In fact, I slept very little in the first weeks because it felt like working, buying food, walking around and talking to people was not enough to spend all the energy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tourism\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tourism\" aria-label=\"tourism permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tourism</h2>\n<p>The tours can be very relaxing and renovating.

Everyone that I met was there either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to do tours</li>\n<li>to work with tours or tourism-related stuff</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At first, I felt that I was in the wrong party because all the people were there just for tours, while I was also interested in that but mostly working with non-tourism stuff and trying to live as I would in any place.</p>\n<p>Almost every conversation started with “what have you done today?” which means “which tours have you done?”, but all I had to answer was something like “I ate lots of grapes, read one chapter of <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28597.Prometheus_Rising\">*Prometheus Rising</a>* in the morning and implemented pagination in some areas of our web application”.</p>\n<p>Some people had every day of their trips booked with tours. In the first days, I started to feel anxious. A feeling that I was missing something for not doing what everyone was doing—fear of missing out. But soon I realized that most of those people were on vacation, and were seriously invested in those days that they are able to travel. Different purposes, different expectations.</p>\n<p>It’s interesting though how the place runs mostly on tourism. I heard stories about how a few decades ago there was almost nothing there (besides the desert of course) and there was a lot of scarcity and poverty. Probably because it was not so cheap to travel and information was not so readily available — i.e. people were not posting photos of the place on Instagram and writing blog posts like this one. Today it has all the basic stuff —water, electricity, internet, minimarkets — , a small but vibrant economy and lots of opportunities for people wanting to make some extra money during the high season.</p>\n<p>It was nice to see how remote work is possible even in isolated and hostile places like this one.</p>\n<p>All in all, it was a great experience that made me feel stronger. Now I would think twice before going to a rustic place like this while working but at the same time, I would also be more prepared to do the same thing if I wanted to.</p>","excerpt":"ThinkPad X1 Carbon probably 1 hour after being last cleaned I recently spent 22 days in San Pedro de Atacama, a tiny town in the middle of…","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/mmc/ghp/personal-static-website/content/blog/how-i-survived-atacama-desert-while-working-remotely/index.md","frontmatter":{"title":"How I survived Atacama desert while working remotely","date":"2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z","image":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
